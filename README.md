# graphql-transport-ws

**(Work in progress!)**

A Go package that leverages WebSockets to transport GraphQL subscriptions, queries and mutations implementing the [Apollo@v0.9.4 protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/v0.9.4/PROTOCOL.md)

See [this repo](https://github.com/matiasanaya/go-graphql-subscription-example) for an example usage.

### Client
